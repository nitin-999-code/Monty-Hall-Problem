          <ol>
            <li>There are 3 doors. Behind one is a car, behind the others, goats.</li>
            <li>You pick a door (but it isn't opened yet).</li>
            <li>The host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens one of the remaining doors, always revealing a goat.</li>
            <li>You can choose to either stay with your original choice or switch to the other unopened door.</li>
            <li>Statistically, you have a 2/3 chance of winning if you switch!</li>
